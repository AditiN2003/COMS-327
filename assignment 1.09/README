This program allowd the user to engage in Pokemon battles between two trainers. The user can pick between 4 options: fight, bag, run, pokemon.
 Fight allows the user to choose moves. 
 Bag allows the user to view and use the supplies. 
 Run allows the user to escape but the PC can only run from wild pokemons. 
 And pokemon allows user to switch to a different pokemon.

 Everything works fine. NOTE: After picking an option, you must go back to map and choose again.
